# Threes

There are already one or two implementations of the game Threes built in JS. I wanted to build this as an exercise before I port it over to Swift. The game is mainly a functional programming build using React for the UI. The game is 100% tested.

## Install

* `npm install`

## Run

* `npm start`

## Tests

* `npm test`
* `npm run test-watch` (run tests continuously)

## TODO

* Add tests for React components
* Refactor
* Show when game is over
* Few Style tweaks
* Show points when game over
* Flip Tiles
